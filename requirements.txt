# Note on PyTorch (torch, torchvision, torchaudio):
# These are installed separately in the Dockerfile using --index-url for specific CUDA compatibility.
# Do not list them here to avoid conflicts.
# Note on FastAPI, Uvicorn (for API serving):
# These are not included here as the current app.py is a script.
# Add them back when/if you convert app.py to an HTTP service:
