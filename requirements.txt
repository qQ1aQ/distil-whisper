# Note on PyTorch (torch):
# The base Docker image 'pytorch/pytorch:2.1.0-cuda12.1-cudnn8-runtime' already includes PyTorch.
# Explicitly installing torch via 'pip install torch --index-url ...' here is generally not needed
# and can sometimes lead to conflicts or redundant installations.
# It's recommended to rely on the PyTorch version provided by the base image.
# If you had 'torch --index-url ...' here, it has been removed.
